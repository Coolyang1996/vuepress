# Summary

A new official plugin `@vuepress/plugin-git-log` featured with more computed properties to be mixed in.

# Basic example

1. Apply the plugin `@vuepress/git-log`.
2. It will provide a computed property `$git`, with following attributes:
   - **$git.updated:** the last updating time for this page
   - **$git.created:** the first creating time for this page
   - **$git.author:** the author for this page
   - **$git.contributors:** this contributors for this page
   - **$git.commits:** this detailed informations of commits to this page

# Motivation

`@vuepress/last-updated` is good, but git-log can provide even more information. If there is such a plugin, it will provide users with a lot of convenience, because they do not need to maintain many meta information of this page.

# Detailed design

## Computed Properties

We will get all computed properties through:

```bash
git log --format="%at %ct %an"
```

Passing the result to client, we will get a `$git.commits` like this:

```json
[{
  "authorTime": 11111111,
  "commitTime": 22222222,
  "author": "fooooooo"
}, {
  "authorTime": 33333333,
  "commitTime": 44444444,
  "author": "baaaaaar"
}]
```

And other computed properties can be derived from this.

## Options

### formatTime

A function to format unix time. It may have two arguments: `time` and `lang`. The default value will be:

```js
function formatTime (timestamp, lang) {
  return new Date(timestamp).toLocaleString(lang)
}
```

### onlyFirstAndLastCommit

If set to `true`, this plugin will only look for the first and last commit, which may save lots of time. The default value is `false`.

### additionalArgs

A string or an array of strings to include all the additional args. The default value will be `'--no-merge'`.

# Drawbacks

- It will replace existing plugin `@vuepress/plugin-last-updated`, which may lead to a breaking change.
- It will cost more time to get all the detailed informations on a large git project than in the past with default options (`onlyFirstAndLastCommit` is `false`).

# Alternatives

Publish may packages like `@vuepress/plugin-last-updated`. But in that case, we may need lots of command lines, which may seriously affect performance.

# Adoption strategy

We will deprecate `@vuepress/plugin-last-updated` after several months. Before then, we will automatically import `@vuepress/plugin-git-log` in `@vuepress/plugin-last-updated` and support both functionality.

```js
// server
module.exports = {
  plugins: ['@vuepress/last-updated']
  // show deprecation warnging
}
```
```js
// client
export default {
  created () {
    console.log(this.$lastUpdated) // show deprecation warnging
    console.log(this.$git.updated)
  }
}
```

# How we teach this

Through official plugin documentation (i.e. `/plugin/official/plugin-git-log.html`).

# Unresolved questions

- Do we need to support more information (i.e. hash for each commit)?
